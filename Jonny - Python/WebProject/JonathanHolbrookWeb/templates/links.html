      Arthur Weasley and the Mega-Prank of the century

      ---
      "Tell us the truth!" George shouted, his wand pointed at my head.
      "I don't know what you're talking about!" I shouted back, my voice trembling.
      "Liar!" they both shouted in unison.
      Another jet of green light hit me and I cried out in pain.
      ---
      
      The day started like any other. I woke up early and tried to get dressed quietly so I wouldn't wake Ron. I put on my battered old sweater and jeans and went downstairs to start breakfast.
      
      I was just putting the frying pan on the stove when Ron came down, looking bleary-eyed and grumpy.
      
      "Oi, Arthur, why's it so bloody cold in here?" he muttered, rubbing his hands together.
      
      I shrugged. "I just woke up."
      
      Ron grumbled and went to sit at the table, yawning widely. I started cooking breakfast, looking forward to the day ahead.
      harry had his first Quidditch practice today. he was looking forward to it; flying always made him feel better.
      But as I cooked, I couldn't help but feel a cold sense of dread in the pit of my stomach. I tried to push it away, but it was hard.
      I knew something was going to happen today. I didn't know what, but I could feel it.
      And I was right.
      A few hours later, I was late for work, I put the pedal to the medal this one time, I had took a shortcut through Hogwarts, past the castle along the bridge and over the pitch...
      
      my foot on the floor
      my mind on my cases
      harry... on my windscreen
      
      I saw him for a split-second and then black,
      I heard Dracos distinctive chortle
      'you demented pauper you've only gone and killed the boy who lived. I mean I'm not complaining or anything. Weasel, you have done the dark lord a great service this day.
      
      scene 2(in which Arthur is rudely awakened):
      
      I woke up to the sound of Ron's voice.
      "Oi, Arthur, wake up! You're going to be late for work!"
      I groaned and sat up, rubbing my eyes. I'd been having the strangest dream, luscious malfoy was casting a memory charm on me
      
      I shook my head to clear it and got up, getting dressed quickly. I grabbed my jacket and scarf and hurried out the door.
      
       scene 3(in which Mr. Weasley gets a phone call):
      
      I was just about to sit down at my desk to when the phone rang.
      I picked it up, my heart sinking when I heard Mrs. Weasley's voice on the other end.
      "Arthur, it's Harry. He's been hurt..."
      "How bad is it?" I asked, dreading the answer.
      "Bad," she replied. "He's in the hospital. You need to come now."
      I grabbed my jacket and hurried out the door.
      I had a feeling this was going to be the start of something bad.
      I rushed to the hospital, my mind racing.
      Ron was going to be devastated.
      I saw Mrs. Weasley as soon as I walked in and she hurried over to me.
      "Arthur, thank goodness you're here," she said, her voice shaking.
      "How is he?" I asked, bracing myself for the answer.
      "Not good," she replied, her eyes filling with tears. "He's in a coma."
      
      scene 4(in which Mr.Weasley gets ticked off by Rons disrespect):
      
      I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I didn't even hear Ron come in.
      "Dad, I'm starving," he said, plopping down in a chair.
      I barely even registered what he said, I was so angry.
      "How can you be so casual?" I snapped. "Harry is in a coma and you're worried about food?"
      Ron's face fell and he looked away.
      "I'm sorry, Dad," he said quietly.
      "You should be," I replied, my voice trembling with anger. "Harry is like a son to me, and you should be worried about him, not yourself."
      Ron didn't say anything, but he looked properly ashamed.
      And he should be.
      
      scene4(in which harry flat-lines):
      
      I was sitting in the waiting room, waiting for news on Harry.
      Ron was with me, but he was being uncharacteristically quiet.
      I think he was still in shock.
      We had been sitting there for hours, when a doctor finally came out.
      He looked tired and wrinkled, like he had seen too much death.
      "Is he okay?" I asked, my voice shaking.
      The doctor shook his head. "I'm sorry, but he didn't make it."
      I felt like I had been punched in the stomach.
      I couldn't believe it.
      Harry was gone.
      'The Doctor put his clipboard down on the desk beside the hardwood bench I was sitting on, and departed with these words of comfort:' '
      'Harry saved us once already, he'd done his work on this Earth' fear crept into the waiting room and a cold breeze displaced the soft hair on top of my head. Yes, now Harry was gone Voldemort would become unstoppable.
      I fidgeted trying to take my mind off the fact, reached out and drew the Doctor's notepad beneath his gaze. Reading the coroner's report I saw a deep purple bruise in the shape of the icon decorating the fender of my 1986 cherry red 'stang
      Oh Merlin's beard, what? I'm gonna be in so much shit for this, Molly's gonna flip her lid. 
      
      act 5:
      
      I don't know how I got through the next few days.
      Ron was a mess, and I was barely holding it together myself.
      Harry's funeral was on a grey, rainy day.
      It felt fitting.
      Molly was in a daze, and I was barely holding it together.
      After the funeral, we all went back to the Burrow.
      Nobody said much.
      We just sat in the kitchen, staring into space.
      I couldn't believe Harry was gone.
      It didn't seem real.
      But it was.
      And life would never be the same.
      
      scene 6:
      
      A few weeks after Harry's funeral, Ron and I were sitting in the kitchen, not really talking.
      The house was eerily quiet without Harry's presence.
      Molly was in the living room, staring at the fire.
      I sighed and got up, walking over to the window.
      I stared out at the empty Quidditch pitch, thinking about Harry, something in my mind stirring.
      I still couldn't believe he was gone.
      I heard Ron get up and come to stand next to me.
      "I miss him, Arthur," he said quietly.
      I nodded, my throat tight.
      "I know, Ron," I said, my voice trembling. "I miss him too... but don't call me Arthur, I'm your dad not your friend, Harrys dead."
      Ron said he felt bad for what he had said earlier about being hungry.
      "ok" I muttered
      "It's just, everything reminds me of him," Ron continued. "I see his broom in the corner and I just start crying."
      I put my arm around him and pulled him close.
      "It's going to be okay, Ron," I said, trying to sound comforting. "We'll get through this."
      But I didn't really believe it.
      How could we ever get through something like this?
      
      scene 7:
      
      "So then I says to Fred, I says 'You put too much powder in the cauldron, it's going to explode!'" George said, laughing.
      "And then Fred, he says 'No, I put the right amount in, it's just going to be a big bang!'"
      I was sitting at the kitchen table, listening to Fred and George regale Ron and I with one of their pranks.
      They had been trying to cheer us up, but it wasn't really working.
      I appreciated the effort, though.
      "So then I lit the fuse and BOOM! The cauldron exploded all over the place!" Fred said, imitating the explosion with his handsa malevolent glint in his eye.
      "Poor old Mum was so mad," George said, shaking his head. "She made us clean it up, but it was worth it."
      They both started laughing again, but I couldn't muster a smile.
      I was still too raw from Harry's death.
      I don't think I would ever be able to laugh again.
      Fred said something which made me wonder,
      "where were you when harry entered his coma?" i said to Fredrick.
      "We were in Diagon Ally buying new school supplies for the year."
      
      "Why didn't you come to the funeral?" I asked, my voice trembling.
      Fred and George both looked at each other, not saying anything.
      Finally, Fred sighed and looked at me.
      "We didn't think you would want us there," he said quietly.
      "Of course we wanted you there!" I exclaimed. "You're Harry's godfathers!"
      "I know, but...," Fred trailed off, not finishing his sentence.
      "But what?" I prompted.
      "But we just thought you would want some privacy," he said finally.
      "You should have been there," I said, my voice breaking. "Harry would have wanted you there."
      Fred and George both looked down at the table, not saying anything.
      
      I knew something wasn't right, I knew they were with him that day.
      I stared at the, thinking... "you did it, you killed him" I exclaimed.
      
      "What?No!"George said, looking alarmed.
      "You killed him!" I shouted, my voice rising. "You killed Harry!"
      "Arthur, we didn't kill him!" Fred said, looking panicked.
      "You did!" I shouted, getting to my feet. "I know you did! You killed him and you left him to die!"
      I was crying now, my whole body shaking with grief and anger.
      "You killed him!" I shouted again, crumbling to the floor in a heap of tears.
      "you killed the son I never had"
      
      They stood there, shaking with rage.
      I glared at them, wishing I could kill them with my bare hands.
      They looked at each other as if deciding something.
      If they had just been there, if they had just stayed with him, Harry would still be alive.
      But they didn't.
      And Harry was dead.
      "honest dad we just needed him out of the picture for a few days so we could concoct the mega-prank. Really, it's still set up. I thought we could go through with it anyway, you know, as a kind of sending off for Harry...'
      'Yeah...?' said George who only thought of pranking
      I said in a hard voice"harrys scared of fireworks"
      "harry WAS scared of fireworks" quiped george
      my eyes bulged 'you naughty droog you killed my boy!' I shouted. they looked at each other then back to me then ran away like their pants were on fire.
      i got my wand out blasted "accio droogs" but they apparated away.
      i cried into my hands feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders.
      
      chapter 10(in which arthur overcome his depression andgets cthartic release giving fred and george a taste of their own medicine):
      
      A few days after the argument with Fred and George, I was sitting in the kitchen, staring at the wall.
      
      I had been in a daze since Harry's death, barely eating or sleeping.
      
      I had lost weight and my hair was starting to fall out.
      
      I was a mess.
      
      But then, something happened.
      
      I don't know what it was, but something inside me snapped.
      
      I got to my feet and started putting on my jacket.
      
      I was going to go to Diagon Alley and give those two a piece of my mind.
      
      I marched out of the house and apparated to Diagon Alley.
      
      I stormed through the crowds, not caring who I bumped into.
      
      I was on a mission.
      
      I finally found them in an alleyway, huddled together and laughing.
      
      "Hey!" I shouted, striding towards them.
      
      They both Looked up, startled.
      
      "What do you want?" Fred asked, his voice full of anger.
      
      "I want to know why you killed Harry," I said, my voice trembling with emotion.
      
      "We didn't kill Harry!" George shouted. "We would never do something like that!"
      
      "You liar!" I shouted, getting in his face. "I know you did it! I know you killed him!"
      
      "Why would we kill Harry?" Fred asked, countering my accusation. "He was our friend!"
      
      "I don't know!" I shouted. "But I know you did it, and I'm going to make you pay!"
      
      I lunged at them, but they disapparated before I could reach them.
      
      I was so angry, I wanted to kill them.
      
      But I knew I couldn't.
      
       Harry would never have wanted me to stoop to their level.
      
      But I could make them suffer.
      
      I spent the next few days planning my revenge.
      
      Finally, I was ready.
      
      I apparated to their house and let myself in.
      
      I went to the kitchen and started putting my plan into action.
      
      I was going to give them a taste of their own medicine.
      
      A few hours later, I was finished.
      
      I apparated back to my house and went to bed, feeling satisfied.
      
      The next morning, I woke up to a loud banging on the door.
      
      I got up and answered it, to find Fred and George standing there, looking enraged.
      
      "What the hell did you do?" Fred shouted.
      
      I just grinned and slammed the door in their faces.
      
      I had finally gotten my revenge.
      
      And it felt good.
      chapter 13(in which arthur bounces back and appears at the ministry for the first time since harry fell into a coma"):
      
      A few weeks after my confrontation with Fred and George, I was starting to feel better.
      
      I had gained some weight and my hair was starting to grow back.
      
      I was even starting to sleep better.
      
      Yesterday, I had gone back to work for the first time since Harry's death.
      
      It felt good to be doing something again.
      
      And today, I was going to the Ministry for the first time since Harry's accident.
      
      I apparated to the Atrium and took a deep breath, bracing myself.
      
      I had been avoiding this place, but I knew I had to face it eventually.
      
      I walked through the gates and made my way to the lifts.
      
      I got in and pressed the button for the Auror office.
      
      The doors closed and the lift started to move.
      
      Suddenly, I was filled with a sense of dread.
      
      I had a feeling something bad was going to happen.
      
      The lift came to a stop and the doors opened.
      
      I stepped out and made my way to the Auror office.
      
      My heart was pounding in my chest.
      
      I was about to reach for the door handle when it was flung open and I was knocked to the ground.
      
      I looked up to see two figures standing over me, their wands drawn.
      
      "You're coming with us," one of them said, grabbing me by the arm and hauling me to my feet.
      
      I tried to struggle, but it was no use.
      
      I was outnumbered and outmatched.
      
      I had no choice but to go with them.
      
      Chapter 14(in which arthur is interrogated by Fred and George):
      
      I was shoved into a chair and my hands were tied behind my back.
      
      I looked around, taking in my surroundings.
      
      I was in some kind of basement, and it was dark and musty.
      
      The only light came from a single, flickering bulb hanging from the ceiling.
      
      "Why did you do it?"
      
      I looked up to see Fred and George standing in front of me, their wands drawn.
      
      "Do what?" I asked, feigning innocence.
      
      "You know what," George said, his voice full of anger. "Why did you ruin our prank?"
      
      "I don't know what you're talking about," I said, trying to buy some time.
      
      "Liar!" Fred shouted, waving his wand at me.
      
      I yelped as a jet of green light shot from his wand and hit the bulb
